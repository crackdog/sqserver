serverport = 6666

the server is logged in with a limited user.

when client connects to server fork server and handle client in child and wait for next client in parent...
save all child pid in list and close them if server shutdown...
maybe make event handler to receive closing of childs...

main fork:    waits for new clients and forks and handle client
client forks: handle the connected client and prevents connection timeout
              closes when connection is closed
logdaemon:    writes all incoming messages into a logfile (maybe udp)
              or filedescriptor...



clienfork waits for incoming messages:
from server:
 -> notifytextmessage...

from client:
 -> nickname...
 <- error id=0 msg=ok
 
 -> clientlist
 <- ..........
 <- error id=0 msg=ok
 
 -> msg...
 <- error id=0 msg=ok
 
 -> poke...
 <- error id=0 msg=ok
 
 
program parts:

- main (starts the server)
- listen_server (waits for new clients and saves the pid's...)
- handle_client (handles one client and exits when connection closed)
